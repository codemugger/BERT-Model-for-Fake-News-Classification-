# BERT Model for Fake News Classification 
Obtaining news online has become the new normal for
many Singaporeans in the information age. The ease of
discovering and sharing news with different news sources
battling to control the narrative has led to a drastic increase
in misinformation. Therefore we need to differentiate
between real and fake news, and this project aims to design
an application to prevent the spreading of fake news by
employing the pre-trained BERT model to detect fake news.
